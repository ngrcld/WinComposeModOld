WinComposeMod
=============

A modified version of WinCompose (https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose): a compose key for Windows, free and opensource, created by Sam Hocevar with the help of [dozens of contributors](https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose/graphs/contributors).

A **compose key** allows to easily write special characters such as **É È** using short and often very intuitive key combinations.
