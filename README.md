WinComposeMod
=============

A modified version of WinCompose (https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose): a compose key for Windows, free and opensource, created by Sam Hocevar with the help of [dozens of contributors](https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose/graphs/contributors).

A **compose key** allows to easily write special characters such as **É È** using short and often very intuitive key combinations.

---

In this modified version, the <kbd>⎄ Compose</kbd> key must be kept pressed to initiate a compose sequence (this key
defaults to <kbd>Right Alt</kbd>).

Compiles with Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 and Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019
